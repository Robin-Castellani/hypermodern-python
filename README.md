# üÜô Hypermodern Python
Improving the way I live Python...

This repository follows the tutorial from 
[Claudio Jolowicz](https://cjolowicz.github.io/posts/hypermodern-python-01-setup/).

## ‚ùî What it is... 
Get some random facts from the Wikipedia API and print them to the CLI.

To configure and run it, run these commands into the shell 
(assuming you have installed at least Python 3.7 and 
[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)):

```
# checkout the repository (the example is via SSH)
git clone git@github.com:Robin-Castellani/my-hypermodern-python.git
cd my-hypermodern-python

# install dependencies in a separated virtual environment
poetry install

# run it
poetry run my-hypermodern-python
```
